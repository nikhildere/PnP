    <h4 class="mdlz-purple-txt">Here are points to consider:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            What is the purpose of the Team? What do you want to accomplish, track or solve by creating it?
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a plan for your Team. What will it look like? What will you call the Team? What channels will be included?
        </li>
        <li>
            Establish a naming convention for your channels
        </li>
        <li>
            Do you have an existing Team that can incorporate a new channel vs creating a new one?
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h4 class="mdlz-purple-txt">Just need to chat and share documents with a few colleagues?</h4>
    You can setup a group chat for that.

    <h4 class="mdlz-purple-txt">What you need to know:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Any employee or contractor with a valid MDLZ email address can request a Team
        </li>
        <li>
            A Team must have two or more owners
        </li>
        <li>
            Owners of an inactive team will be sent an email notification every 6 months to confirm that the team is required and needs to be retained. In case none of the owners respond, the team will be deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Business partners can be added to your Team. You need to send a <a href="https://irequest.mdlz.com/sc/catalog.product.aspx?product_id=appacc_bp_invitebp">business partner invitation</a> to start the process. Once the invite is accepted by the business partner, a Teams owner can add the business partner to their Team.
